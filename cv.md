#### About Me
I love to create conditions for myself in which my learning of code will be inevitable. When I discovered RS School, I was pleasantly surprised, because all conditions have been already created. My first goal on the course is to go through all the stages, learn with a mentor, write code as a team, and make the final project. The next goal is to find acceptable conditions (my future work) where I will grow as a developer with the people who will be surround me.
